Simulacra VR
========

# Overview

MUSIC INSTRUMENTS IN VR

SVR is a platform for musicologists, enthusiasts to play hyperinstruments in virtual reality.

Simulacra is a tool that helps you design virtual sound worlds with abstract instruments.The infrastructure enable users without musicality develop sophisticated instruments. 


# Hyperinstruments

Simulacra is a hyperinstrument that approaches musical instruments as haptic devices.Simulacra uses machine learning techniques to create experimental instruments which gives musicians the ability to make music using completely new sounds. It helps experience a cross between music and perception.




### "IoT" interactions
far-range interaction via raycast direction & pinch. Static display of contextual information, sigle value drag ajustment, binary pinch-click to expand a more complex piece of UI.

### MATH
Experimentation of hybrid particles movement on GPU with 2D eulerian fluid and 3D particles simulation. The closest to the ground, the more influenced by the fluid simulation.

### TOOLS

Pure Data
## Simple verlet integration simulator for Unity.

This will simulate hair interactables for synthesis of granular sounds

## Musical improvisation

## 3D Prints

Printed instruments can be exported for musical playing . Ray Kurtzweil has talked about his prediction that in 2020 we will be able to digitally download 3D assets.

### EXAMPLES
 * Machine Learning
  It gives musicians the ability to explore completely new sounds generated by the NSynth machine learning algorithm.

# HandUI

This repo contains examples of UI design for tracked hands in AR/VR featuring remote interaction, and some general hand-related components and utilities that I use for rapid prototyping. HandUI works with Leap Motion’s API.
